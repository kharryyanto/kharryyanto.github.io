Hi there!

My name is Kevin, and I'm an AI engineer with a passion for bleeding-edge AI, particularly in Natural Language Processing. I've been working as an AI engineer for almost one year, and I've had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects, including developing a character chatbot that can generate responses with a certain personality, and heavily optimizing Large Language Models to greatly increase their speed and quality of responses and decrease the resources required to train and deploy them. I'm always looking for new challenges, and I'm excited to share my work and my story with you on this website.

Outside of work, I'm an avid reader and writer. I love reading and writing across a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, philosophy, economics, and physics. I'm also a big fan of role-playing games, especially ones with really good storytelling.

I'm excited to share my work and my story with you on this website. I hope you'll take some time to explore my website, and I'd love to hear from you if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks for visiting!
